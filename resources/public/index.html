                    <h2>What is the Complex Grapher?</h2>
                    <p>The Complex Grapher creates visualizations of complex functions (i.e. functions of a complex variable). If you are unfamiliar with complex numbers and functions, you can <a data-scroll href="#expl">click here</a> to learn more about them.</p>
                    <p>This program uses the <i>domain coloring</i> method to graph complex functions. The graph is a representation of the complex plane: each pixel corresponds to a complex number $z$, with the pixel's  horizontal and vertical position representing the real and imaginary components of $z$, respectively. The color of the pixel is determined by the value of $f(z)$, where $f$ is the function that is being graphed. <a data-scroll href="#domain">Click here</a> to read more about domain coloring.</p>

                    <h2>Using the Complex Grapher</h2>
                    <p>You can enter a mathematical expression in the "Function" textbox. The expression must use $z$ as the input variable. The imaginary unit $i$ is also valid, as well as the constants $\pi$ and $e$, which can be expressed as "pi" and "e" in the textbox. The Complex Grapher currently supports the following mathematical operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^). Additionally, the following built-in functions are supported: sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), the natural logarithm (log), the real part function (re), the imaginary part function (im), the argument function (arg), and the magintude function (mag).</p>
                    <p>The "Magnitude modulus" textbox must contain a number greater than 0. To find out what this value does, please read the section on <a data-scroll href="#domain">domain coloring.</a></p>
                    <p>The "Top left corner" label specifies the complex number which is represented by the top-left pixel on the graph. The "Bottom right corner" label does the same for the opposite corner.</p>
                    <p>The arrow buttons shift the graph along the complex plane, while the plus/minus buttons zoom the graph in and out.</p>

                    <h2>Domain Coloring: How it Works</h2>
                    <p>In domain coloring, each pixel on the graph corresponds to a complex number $z$. The pixel's horizontal and vertical positions represent the real and imaginary components of $z$, respectively. The value of $f(z)$ is then calculated, and the pixel's color is based on this value.</p>
                    <p>The color does not depend on the real/imaginary components of $f(z)$: the argument and magnitude of $f(z)$ are used instead. The argument determines the hue, while the magnitude determines the brightness.</p>
                    <p>We come across an issue here: the pixel's brightness has a maximum, while the magnitude of $f(z)$ does not. So, the magnitude is computed modulo some number $n$ in order to keep it within a certain range. The "Modulo magnitude" setting controls the value of this number $n$. If $m$ is the magnitude of $f(z)$, then the exact formula for calculating the brightness is:</p>
                    <p class="bigmath">$$b = \begin{cases} (m\% n)/n, & \mbox{if } (m\% 2n) \leq n \\ 1- (m\% n)/n, & \mbox{if } (m\% 2n) > n \end{cases}$$</p>
                    <p>where $b$ is the brightness, in the range 0 to 1 inclusive.</p>

                    <h2>An Introduction to Complex Numbers</h2>
                    <p><i>The following is a brief explanation of complex numbers for those who are unfamiliar with the concept.</i></p>
                    <p>You've probably been taught in high school that you can't calculate the square root of a negative number. It's certainly true that the result won't be a <i>real number</i>, but what if we create an entirely new set of numbers to account for square roots of negatives? Let's start by creating a number which we will call $i$:</p>
                    <p>$$i = \sqrt{-1}$$</p>
                    <p>The square root of any negative number can now be written as a multiple of $i$. For example:</p>
                    <p>$$\sqrt{-9}$$
                    $$=\sqrt{9}\sqrt{-1}$$
                    $$=3i$$</p>
                    <p>Numbers that are a multiple of $i$ are not real numbers: hence, they are named <i>imaginary numbers</i>. $3i$, $5i$, $6.24i$, and $\pi i$ are all examples of imaginary numbers. The constant $i$ is known as the <i>imaginary unit.</i></p>
                    <p>But what happens if we add a real number and an imaginary number together? The result is called a <i>complex number</i>. Any number of the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, is a complex number. $a$ is called the <i>real part</i>, while $b$ is called the <i>imaginary part</i>. Note that $a$ and/or $b$ can be equal to 0, and therefore all real numbers and all imaginary numbers are also complex numbers.</p>
                    <p>Arithmetic with complex numbers is very similar to arithmetic with real numbers. Basic rules of arithmetic still apply. For example, let's simplify the expression $(3i+1)(5i-7)$:</p>
                    <p class="bigmath">$$(3i+1)(5i-7)$$
                    $$=(3i)(5i)-(3i)(7)+(1)(5i)-(1)(7)$$
                    $$=15i^2-21i+5i-7$$
                    $$=-15-16i-7$$
                    $$=-16i-22$$</p>
                    <p>How can we visualize complex numbers? While real numbers are visualized as part of a number line, complex numbers are visualized as part of the <i>complex plane</i>: this is simply a Cartesian plane, with the $x$-axis representing the real part of a complex number, and the $y$-axis representing the imaginary part. For example, the number $3+2i$ is drawn on the complex plane below:</p>
                    <div class="svg-wrapper"><img src="32i.svg"></div>
                    <p>There is an alternative way to represent complex numbers. Instead of expressing a complex number in terms of real and imaginary parts, it can be expressed in terms of <i>argument</i> and <i>magnitude</i>. Consider the number $z=a+bi$, plotted on the complex plane below:</p>
                     <div class="svg-wrapper"><img src="argmag.svg"></div>
                    <p>The angle $\theta$ between the arrow and the $x$-axis is called the <i>argument</i> of $z$. The length of the arrow, $m$, is called the <i>magnitude</i> of $z$. With some basic trigonometry, and the Pythagorean theorem, it is possible to express the argument and magnitude in terms of $a$ and $b$:</p>
                    <p>$$\theta=\text{tan}^{-1}(b/a)$$
                    $$m=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$
                    </p>
